    1.What is Android Architecture?
    *Android architecture refers to the overall design and structure of an Android app, including how its components interact, how data is managed and processed, and how it handles different states and events. It's important to choose a well-designed architecture to create apps that are easy to develop, test, and maintain. Common patterns include Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), and Clean Architecture.

    2.Android Architecture Components
    *Android Architecture Components is a set of libraries provided by Google that aims to simplify and improve the development of Android applications. It provides a consistent and well-defined approach to building robust and maintainable apps.

    *Android has a component-based architecture - where you use different components like Activities, Fragments, Services, etc.
    *It is Android that manages these components for you.
    *Till now , we have been writing code in our android activities or fragments for all purposes-whether it is data fetching or storing data in SQLite.
    *This is where the Problem lies.

    3.Problems with existing system
    *Data Driven Application.
    *Concern of separation.
    *Configuration Change.

    4.What is Jetpack?
    *Collection of Libraries that helps build robust, testable and maintainable android apps.
    *Jetpack is a booster for your android apps. you can use these libraries to boost your android apps development process and build production ready apps.
    *Less Boilerplate code- Room, Navigation Components, Paging etc.
    *High Quality, Production Ready Apps.
